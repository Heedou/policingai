  "section_outline": "<Theoretical Part> > VI. Crimes Against Property and Special Provisions for Family Members",
  "content": "VI. Special Provisions for Crimes Against Property Committed by Family Members\n\n1. Definition\nThe special legal provision for crimes among close family members is based on the principle that the law should refrain from intervening in such cases as much as possible. It is applied mutatis mutandis to property crimes (except for damage and robbery) as stipulated under the Criminal Act’s provision on obstruction of rights. Because this provision may result in either a judgment of exemption from punishment (a personal grounds for exclusion of criminal liability) or change the prosecutorial requirements (i.e., requiring a relative’s complaint), it is necessary to check for family relationships when reviewing complaints or statements related to property crimes.\n\n2. Scope of Family Relationship\n- According to case law, the provision applies only when both the owner and the possessor of the property are relatives. For example, if a grandson transfers funds from his grandfather’s bank account to his own via an ATM, the bank—being the victim—is not a relative and thus the provision does not apply.\n- The family relationship must exist at the time of the criminal act. Even if the relationship ends later, it does not affect applicability. Also, when a child born out of wedlock is later recognized (acknowledged) by the biological parent, the recognition applies retroactively and the provision can apply even to crimes committed before the recognition.\n\n※Relevant Laws:\n- Civil Act Article 855 (Acknowledgment of Illegitimate Children)\n- Civil Act Article 860 (Retroactive Effect of Acknowledgment)\n\n3. Legal Effect\nThis provision may lead to a judgment of exemption from punishment or alter the requirements for prosecution (e.g., requiring a complaint from the victim).\n\n4. Special Provision for Crimes of Receiving Stolen Property (Criminal Act Article 365)\n- If the perpetrator and victim of a receiving offense are in a family relationship as defined in Article 328(1)(2), the same rules apply.\n- If the perpetrator and principal offender are family, the punishment may be mitigated or exempted. However, co-offenders who are not family are excluded from this benefit.\n\n5. Application to Fraud and Extortion\nIn the case of litigation fraud, although the deceived party (i.e., the court) is not a relative, if the actor and the actual economic victim are relatives, the provision applies (Case 75Do781).\n※ In embezzlement or breach of trust cases, since the trustor is also a victim, the actor must be related to both the owner and the trustor for the provision to apply.\n\n6. Civil Code Provisions (with inline explanations)\nIncludes definitions and scope of relatives and in-laws, rules for calculating kinship degree, and provisions on termination of family relations due to divorce, annulment, or remarriage.\n\n- Civil Act Article 767: Definition of Relatives\n- Article 768: Definition of Blood Relatives\n- Article 769: Definition of Affinity (In-Laws)\n- Article 770: Calculation of Degree of Blood Relation\n- Article 771: Calculation of Degree of Affinity\n- Article 775: Termination of Affinity\n- Article 777: Scope of Relatives (legal effect limited to 8th-degree blood relatives, 4th-degree in-laws, and spouses)\n- Article 779: Scope of Family (nuclear and extended family depending on cohabitation)\n- Article 855 & 860: Acknowledgment and retroactive recognition of illegitimate children",
  "document_topic": "Special Legal Provisions for Property Crimes Committed by Family Members",
  "question": "How does the special legal provision for family members apply in cases of fraud and extortion?",
  "answer": "In fraud and extortion cases, the special legal provision for family members applies if there is a family relationship between the actor and the actual economic victim. In litigation fraud, even though the deceived entity is the court (not a relative), the provision still applies if the actor and the economic victim are relatives."

  "content": "1. Persons with Mental Illness under the Mental Health Act\n\na. Definition\nA person with mental illness is defined as someone with mental disorders including psychosis (including organic psychosis), personality disorders, alcohol and drug addiction, and other non-psychotic mental disorders (Article 3, Mental Health Act).\n※ A ‘person with mental illness’ under Article 3 of the Mental Health Act corresponds to ‘mentally disturbed’ under Article 4(1)(1) of the Police Duties Execution Act.\n\nb. Legal Guardians for Persons with Mental Illness\n- Legal Guardians (Article 21):\nⅠ. Statutory obligors under the Civil Code or legal guardians (Paragraph 1).\n※ However, individuals who are adult wards, limited guardians, bankrupt and not reinstated, involved in ongoing or past lawsuits against the person with mental illness, their spouses, minors, or missing persons cannot act as guardians.\nⅡ. If no such guardian exists or they are unable to perform their duties, the mayor, county governor, or district head (Paragraph 3) becomes the guardian.\n※ If the residence is unknown or unavailable, the current local government head assumes the role.\n\n- Duties of Legal Guardians (Article 22):\n■ Ensure the person receives proper treatment (Para. 1)\n■ Ensure safety of the person and others (Para. 2)\n■ Protect the person's property and legal rights; abandonment is prohibited (Para. 3)\n※ Abandonment is punishable by up to 5 years in prison or a fine of up to 50 million KRW (Article 55(1))\n\nc. Types of Hospitalization\nThe Mental Health Act classifies hospitalization into four types: voluntary, guardian-initiated, mayor/governor/district head-initiated, and emergency hospitalization. Police officers are mainly involved in emergency hospitalization (Article 26).\n\n- Voluntary Hospitalization (Article 23):\nInitiated by the patient’s own application.\n\n- Guardian-Initiated Hospitalization (Article 24):\n■ Subject: Person with mental illness\n■ Applicant: Two legal guardians (or one if only one exists)\n■ Condition: Psychiatrist must deem hospitalization necessary\n\n- Mayor/Governor/District Head-Initiated Hospitalization (Article 25):\n■ Subject: Person suspected to be a danger to self or others due to mental illness\n■ Reporter: Psychiatrist or mental health professional\n※ Mental health professionals include clinical psychologists, psychiatric nurses, and social workers\n■ Method: After discovery, application for diagnosis and protective custody is submitted to local government, which must refer for psychiatric evaluation. This is used for non-urgent risk situations.\n\n- Emergency Hospitalization (Article 26):\n■ Subject: Person presumed mentally ill and poses immediate threat to self or others\n■ Initiator: The individual who discovered the subject\n※ Police officers are not initiators but can approve emergency hospitalization requests\n■ Condition: Emergency circumstances where other forms of admission are not possible\n■ Method: Upon agreement from a physician and police officer, subject can be admitted to a mental health facility for up to 72 hours; continued hospitalization is evaluated afterward\n\nd. Operation of Mental Health Centers\n- Legal Basis (Article 13-2): National and local governments must strive to establish mental health centers at the city/county/district level to support mental health services including discovery, counseling, treatment, rehabilitation, and case management.\n- As of May 2015, 203 mental health centers were established nationwide.\n- Mental health centers serve as points of referral when someone suspected of mental illness is discovered. They can provide consultation, recommend appropriate hospitals/facilities, and house professionals who may initiate hospitalization under Article 25.",
