  "conversation": "Yes, thank you. I reported a stalking incident yesterday. After that, I went to the police station, and then I received a call and a message from the person saying, 'I'm going to die.' I even received a message saying the person died at [time]. I'm worried because I don’t know whether they are just trying to scare me or if it’s real. I can’t call and have no way to verify the situation. Has the police station received any death reports? We can only verify report history by phone number, but I haven't received any related death report so far. I don’t know what to do in this situation. I was going to meet the person outside, but they messaged saying they would die, saying they’d 'hang themselves to die.' And then I received a message from their number saying they had died. I don’t know their home address, but I do know they went to [store/business name]. The police will be arriving soon. Wait a moment, I need to sort this out. I had contact with the stalker again, and they sent a message saying they would hang themselves, and then a message came saying they were dead at [time]. I’m reporting this now because I’m worried—it might be real or just a threat. What I know for now is that 'the stalker is the same person as before,' and that 'no death report has been received yet.' Let me organize this a little more. Yes, this is the Seoul Metropolitan Police Agency. A report came in from a stalking victim. The perpetrator sent a suicide-threatening message and then a message claiming they died. We are checking the number; no related report exists as of now. The stalker contacted the victim and sent a message threatening suicide, followed by one claiming they had died. The message came from the perpetrator’s number, but they are now unreachable. We haven’t tried calling yet. It's an urgent situation, and we are trying to locate the perpetrator. The person is an acquaintance of the reporter and sent suicidal messages. No report has been filed yet. The reporter's phone number is [phone number]. The stalker was a friend and ex-lover; there had been dating violence. Yes, they were in a past relationship, and now we’re considering a third-party location information request. The person’s name is [name], and the phone number is [phone number]. We’ll now proceed with the location request, but I must give you a legal notice: location results won’t be shared with the requester, and false reports may result in a fine of up to 10 million won. The person is in their 50s, born in 1970, and an investigation is underway. An officer will arrive shortly, so please wait.",

  "conversation": "Yes, this is [Name] Headquarters. Hello? Yes, please go ahead. There's a woman here. Sorry? She's in the same house and won’t leave. Who is the woman? Someone I was seeing. I reported it last time too. Yes. She won’t go. What’s your location? [Address]. You said you wouldn’t do this. Wait a moment. Didn’t you say that? If I talk to the woman at [address], will this be cancelled? You said you wouldn’t do this. Hello? You said you wouldn’t. Hold on, yes, go ahead. [Address]—if I speak to the woman there, will the report be cancelled? Hello? Is this [address]? Yes, hold on. It’s nothing serious, we were just talking and the button must’ve been pressed by mistake, so you don’t need to come. Hello. Oh, this is Songpo… us. Yes. Yes. Oh, we’re fine. It seems like the call button was just accidentally pressed, so everything’s okay. No, really, it’s fine. If anything happens, we’ll call again, but there’s nothing wrong now. Can you put the man back on the phone? Yes. Since the woman also says everything’s fine, what do you think, sir? Okay, got it. So, we won’t come then? Yes. Okay. Yes. Alright.",
  "output": "[Reporter’s Situation]\n1. The reporter is a male who says the woman he used to date came to his home and is refusing to leave. The woman then takes the phone and explains it's not a serious issue.\n\n[Police Response]\n1. The officer asks the male reporter whether he agrees with the woman that nothing is wrong. Since the reporter confirms he doesn’t want police dispatch, officers decide not to respond."

  "conversation": "Yes, I’d like to ask something. My grandson is in elementary school, born in [Date of Birth]. Who? My grandson. He was born in [Date of Birth] and goes to a private academy, and it seems there’s another kid riding the academy bus with him—seems like they’ve become friends, but this kid keeps bothering him. I’ve talked to the academy, but they just tell them not to fight. But it happens on the academy bus. They're not in the same class at school or the academy, but the kid always sits next to my grandson on the bus and keeps bothering him. My grandson says he doesn't want to go to the academy anymore. From what I’ve heard, the other kid even calls my son (the child’s father) at work. So I was wondering if a police officer in uniform could be there before the bus departs, just to stop the bullying. Apparently, the kid keeps slapping my grandson, while my grandson only talks back verbally. And this kid seems quite aggressive. Even though times have changed, don’t the other kid’s parents know about this? My son—the boy’s father—has a job, and when something happens, the boy always calls him. This doesn’t sound like something where an officer should actually board the bus, especially with other children there. I think it would be better if your son spoke with the academy and asked them to talk to the other child’s parents first. That’s true. But at that age, parents of 1st and 2nd graders usually come to pick them up, while the older kids like mine don’t. I see. So I suggest your son first contacts the academy and asks them to get in touch with the other kid’s parents. And if that doesn’t work and the bullying continues, then you can call us again and we’ll take further steps. That makes sense, right? If the parents don’t resolve it, then maybe having a uniformed officer show up would scare the kid enough to stop the bullying. I know it sounds extreme, but sometimes being firm from the start works. Even in marriage, being firm from the beginning helps. But it’s not good for kids to see officers in uniform in that way—it’s not good for their education. I understand. I’ll try that first and if it doesn’t improve, I’ll call again. Okay, please do. Thank you.",
  "output": "[Caller’s Request]\n1. The caller’s grandson, a 4th grader, is being bullied by a girl who rides the same academy bus. The academy was informed but only told the kids not to fight, and the bullying reportedly continues on the bus.\n\n[Police Response]\n1. The officer advises that since the issue is between children, it’s not appropriate for police to intervene directly. The caller is encouraged to contact the academy and speak with the other child’s parents first."
