  "hypothesis": "A confrontation between a witness and a suspect involves placing them face-to-face so that the witness can confirm whether the suspect is indeed the perpetrator.",
  "hypothesis_answer": "True",
  "premise": "\npremise 1: Types of perpetrator identification procedures (confrontation between witness and suspect)\nIt is possible to place the witness and the suspect face-to-face to confirm whether the suspect is the perpetrator. At this time, the witness is informed that the person they are confronting may or may not be the perpetrator. Before the confrontation, the suspect is notified of the witness's description of the perpetrator, and if the witness or suspect does not wish to proceed, they are not forced to face each other (U.K. practice).\npremise 2: Factors affecting identification accuracy (appropriate homogeneity)\nThis relates to how the control group in a lineup is selected. Usually, people who resemble the suspect are chosen as the control group. However, there are two different strategies here. One is to select individuals who resemble the suspect identified by investigators. In this case, the witness may be biased to identify the suspect most similar to their own description. The second strategy is to select individuals who resemble the description of the perpetrator given by the witness, which can improve identification accuracy compared to the first strategy.\npremise 3: To ensure the credibility of a witness's testimony in perpetrator identification procedures, the witness's statements or descriptions regarding the suspect’s appearance should be recorded in detail beforehand. Then, the suspect should be presented along with others of similar appearance for simultaneous confrontation with the witness. Additionally, the suspect, witness, and other individuals involved should not have any prior contact. To allow later evaluation of evidentiary value, the confrontation process and results should be documented in writing or photographs. The same principles apply to photo-based identification procedures. (Supreme Court 2003Do7033)\npremise 4: In general, showing a witness a single suspect in person or a single photograph to confirm identification can lower the credibility of the witness’s statement due to limitations and inaccuracies of human memory and the implicit suggestion that the person presented is the perpetrator. Unless there are additional circumstances—such as prior acquaintance between the suspect and the victim, or corroborating evidence—the credibility of the witness is considered low. Thus, to enhance credibility, the witness's statements should be recorded in detail beforehand, and multiple individuals with similar appearance, including the suspect, should be simultaneously presented to the witness. Contact between the parties should be avoided, and the process and results must be documented. However, in cases where the witness's memory is fresh immediately after the crime and the procedure is conducted on-site or nearby, one-on-one confrontations may be permitted due to the likelihood of accurate identification and the urgency of solving the crime. (Supreme Court 2008Do12111)\npremise 5: Showing a witness a single suspect or a single photograph in perpetrator identification procedures can suggest, consciously or unconsciously, that the person is the perpetrator, lowering the credibility of the witness’s statement—unless other supporting circumstances exist. Therefore, the witness's testimony should be carefully recorded in advance, suspects and similarly appearing individuals should be presented together, and prior contact must be prevented. The confrontation and results should be documented. These principles apply not only to photo-based procedures but also to video presentation, street identification, and any post-identification procedures. (Supreme Court 2007Do5201)"

  "hypothesis": "Under the current Road Traffic Act, riding a bicycle under the influence of alcohol is not punishable.",
  "hypothesis_answer": "True",
  "premise": "\npremise 1: The defendant, who had previously been convicted four times of violating the Road Traffic Act for drunk driving, was indicted for driving an electric scooter under the influence of alcohol under the former Road Traffic Act (prior to the amendment by Act No. 17371 on June 9, 2020, which took effect on December 10, 2020). The amendment introduced definitions for 'personal mobility devices,' such as electric scooters, and 'bicycles, etc.,' in Articles 2(19-2) and 2(21-2), respectively. As a result, drunk driving involving personal mobility devices was excluded from the scope of Article 148-2, which applies to drunk driving of motor vehicles. Instead, Article 156(11), which governs drunk driving of bicycles and similar devices, applies, with lighter statutory penalties. Since the amendment reduced the applicable penalties and there was no transitional provision, the conduct must be judged under the amended, more lenient law, pursuant to Article 1(2) of the Criminal Act. Therefore, the appellate court’s judgment based on the former law was no longer maintainable. (Supreme Court En Banc Decision 2020Do16420)\n\npremise 2: Under the former Road Traffic Act (prior to the amendment by Act No. 5712 on January 29, 1999), Article 107-2(2) penalized those who, while reasonably suspected of being intoxicated, refused to submit to a sobriety test under Article 41(2). However, this only applied when the driving occurred on a 'road' as defined in Article 2(1). Therefore, if the location did not meet the definition of a road, even driving a vehicle while intoxicated would not be punishable under this provision. (99Do2127)\n\npremise 3: A defendant previously convicted of drunk driving refused a sobriety test despite reasonable grounds to believe they had driven a motor vehicle under the influence. The trial court found them guilty under Articles 148-2(1) and 44(2) of the Road Traffic Act. However, after the ruling, the Constitutional Court ruled those provisions (specifically the part concerning repeat offenders) unconstitutional. As a result, these provisions lost effect retroactively under Article 47(3) of the Constitutional Court Act, and the case no longer constituted a criminal offense. (2021Do14878)\n\npremise 4: The legislative intent of Article 74 of the Road Traffic Act is to emphasize a high standard of care due to the inherent danger of vehicle operation and to protect third-party property unrelated to the vehicle operation itself. Therefore, the vehicle used in the crime cannot be considered the legal interest protected by the provision concerning property damage. (75Do3751)\n\npremise 5: Drunk driving punishable under the Road Traffic Act refers to operating a vehicle with a blood alcohol concentration of 0.05% or more, as stipulated in Article 107-2(1), Article 41(1) and (4), and Enforcement Decree Article 31. Thus, a specific blood alcohol concentration must be determined to constitute a punishable offense. (98Do138)"

  "hypothesis": "If a person participates in an assembly that significantly exceeds the scope reported under the Assembly and Demonstration Act and causes a traffic obstruction, then even if the flow of traffic had already been blocked by other participants at the time of their participation, the offense of obstruction of general traffic may be established if it can be evaluated that the person implicitly or sequentially conspired with others to maintain the unlawful traffic obstruction.",
  "hypothesis_answer": "True",
  "premise": "\npremise 1: If participants in an assembly held without prior notice under the Assembly and Demonstration Act march on the road and thereby obstruct or significantly hinder traffic flow, the crime of obstruction of general traffic may be established. However, this does not apply automatically to all participants. Rather, the crime can only be established if the participant either directly engaged in conduct causing traffic obstruction or can be held criminally liable as a co-conspirator based on their manner of participation or degree of involvement. (2017Do9146)\n\npremise 2: The crime of obstruction of general traffic is classified as an abstract endangerment offense and is complete when traffic becomes impossible or significantly difficult; actual harm is not required. Furthermore, the act of obstructing traffic constitutes a continuing offense, meaning the unlawful state persists as long as the obstruction continues. Therefore, even if the flow of traffic had already been blocked by others when a person joined the assembly, if it can be assessed that the person implicitly or sequentially conspired with others to maintain the unlawful obstruction, the crime of obstruction of general traffic may still be established. (2017Do9146)\n\npremise 3: In a case where the defendant, after attending the ‘First Anniversary Sewol Ferry National Action’ memorial event held at Seoul Plaza without prior notice, crossed the police line along with other participants, occupied all lanes of a road while following a broadcast vehicle, and remained in the roadway in confrontation with police before leaving: it was held that because the defendant and others crossed the police-designated line and marched occupying all lanes, there was implicit and sequential unity of intent among participants. Given that the defendant accepted and directly engaged in unlawful acts of obstructing traffic with awareness of the illegality, and the road occupation caused complete blockage of vehicle passage, the defendant functionally contributed to the crime and thus shared criminal responsibility as a co-conspirator. Therefore, the appellate court’s judgment acquitting the defendant was overturned for legal error in understanding joint criminal enterprise in obstruction of general traffic. (2017Do9146)\n\npremise 4: In a case where union members held a rally calling for faithful collective bargaining and obstructed vehicle traffic by conducting a 'three-steps-one-bow' march without prior notice, it was ruled that the method of protest, when viewed in light of place, manner, content, method, and outcome, only caused tolerable harm under social norms and did not significantly interfere with the objectives of the reporting system under the Assembly and Demonstration Act. Hence, the act constituted a justifiable act not violating social norms. (2009Do840)\n\npremise 5: The purpose of the reporting requirement under the Assembly and Demonstration Act is to facilitate administrative preparedness. Whether an assembly or demonstration exceeds the scope of the report under Article 16(4)(3) must be determined based on whether the actual event significantly hindered the objectives of the reporting system. In making this determination, one must consider that freedom of assembly is a constitutional right, that it is practically difficult for organizers to foresee and report all details in advance, and that changes during the event may be unavoidable. Therefore, the reported content and actual circumstances must be compared specifically and individually, and the assessment should be made in a comprehensive and holistic manner. (2009Do12609)"
