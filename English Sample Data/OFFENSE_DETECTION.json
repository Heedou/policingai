On or around July 25, 2012, at the office of Company C, the defendant told Sales Representative F of Company E (the victim company), 'We previously supplied single-channel black boxes, but we are now planning to produce a new HD-quality dual-channel black box with added features. This product includes an algorithm-based license plate tracking function and is of high technical quality. To receive this product, an advance payment is required. If you make the deposit, we will certainly deliver the product in time for the Chuseok holiday (September 30, 2017) via home shopping sales,'—which was a false statement. In fact, Company C was experiencing a shortage of operational funds, the dual-channel black box was still under development and not yet commercialized, and the advance payment from the victim company was intended to be used for general operating expenses. Thus, the defendant had neither the intent nor the capacity to deliver the product. Nevertheless, deceiving the victim company, the defendant induced them to transfer KRW 2.52 billion on August 20, 2012, to a G Bank account (number: H) under the name of 'Company D' as payment for 15,000 units of the black box product (Product I), and thereby obtained the funds fraudulently.",
